  Marga - A Journey Back to My Beginnings

Welcome to *Marga*, one of the very first projects I built when I started learning web development. This project holds a special place in my heart as it represents the curiosity, excitement, and even the frustrations of my early coding days.

  Why Marga?
Back when I was just starting, I wanted to create something simple yet functional. I didn’t know much about frameworks, modern tools, or best practices — I only had HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of JavaScript in my toolkit. Despite the simplicity, I poured my heart into this project to make it the best I could at the time.

  What Does It Include?
- *HTML:* The backbone of this project — pure, clean (or as clean as it could be) HTML.
- *CSS:* My experiments with stylesheets, from inline styles to external files, all in one project.
- *JavaScript:* Small touches of interactivity, using basic vanilla JS and jQuery.
- *Bootstrap:* A bit of help from Bootstrap to make things look presentable.

  Directory Structure
- *index.html*: The main page of the website.
- *css/*: Custom styles and external libraries like Bootstrap and FontAwesome.
- *js/*: Scripts including jQuery and plugins.
- *fonts/*: IRANSansWeb font files in multiple formats.
- *image/*: A collection of images used throughout the website.

  What Did I Learn?
Creating Marga taught me:
- The power of combining structure (HTML), design (CSS), and logic (JavaScript).
- How to troubleshoot issues (a lot of trial and error went into this!).
- The importance of staying curious and never giving up, even when things don’t work the way you want.

  A Message to You
If you’re just starting your journey in web development, let this project remind you that everyone begins somewhere. It’s not about perfection; it’s about progress. Every line of code you write, no matter how simple, is a step forward.

Take a look around and enjoy this little piece of nostalgia!
